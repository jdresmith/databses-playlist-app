## Getting started with Playlist-app

This app was created Python, SQL and Flask.

To get this application running, make sure you do the following in the Terminal:

1. `python3 -m venv venv`
2. `source venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `createdb playlist-app`
5. `flask run`

This database app was made to imitate a music application where users can view songs, create playlists and modify them as needed.

Songs can be added to the databses and directed to a specific playlist based on the user's criteria.

Likewise, user can create playlist based on their own criteria and add songs at their discretion. Forms are displayed to allow users to customize as they please.
